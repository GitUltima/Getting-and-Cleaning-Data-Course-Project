# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Repo with the code for performing my analysis. The code should has a file run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory. The output should be the "tidy data set."There is a README.md in the repo describing how the script works and the code book describing the variables.

RUN_ANALYSIS.R THAT DOES THE FOLLOWING
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Link to samsung data is in the description of the run_analysis.R in the main directory.
Please follow code book for all variables.
