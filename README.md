# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Repo with the code for performing my analysis. The code should has a file run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory. The output should be the "tidy data set."There is a README.md in the repo describing how the script works and the code book describing the variables.
